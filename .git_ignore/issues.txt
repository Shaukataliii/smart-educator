JUST CHECK THE CONDITION THAT IS CHECKING FOR DUPLICATE ENTRY AND PREVENTING AS IT IS NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED.
THE ISSUE CAN BE OF FORMATING (WILL SEE LATER)

SAME ISSUE IS BEING FACED IN EXAMS-PERFORMANCE ALSO.

HAVE TO ADD A FEE STATUS SECTION IN THE ADMISSION/NEW TAB. HAVE TO USE (IS NOT NAN) TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHOSE FEE IS NOT PAID YET.

IN THE FINANCIAL TAB, TEACHER SHOULD BE ABLE TO UPDATE FEE STATUS. (yes/no)

DATA NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED.

USE 0 FOR OTHER DISCIPLINE PARAMS IF THE STUDENT IS ABSENT. (This will automatically reduce its performance.). SAME FOR TEST MARKS.
